## üéØ Simplified MVP Scope

### **MUST HAVE (Core MVP)**
- ‚úÖ Upload meeting transcript (text only)
- ‚úÖ Detect ticket mentions (PROJ-123 format)
- ‚úÖ Basic meeting summary
- ‚úÖ Jira tab panel showing meeting context
- ‚úÖ "Runs on Atlassian" compliance

### **SHOULD HAVE (If Time Allows)**
- ‚úÖ Python-enhanced text processing
- ‚úÖ Action item extraction
- ‚úÖ Multiple meeting history
- ‚úÖ Basic UI improvements

### **WON'T HAVE (Post-MVP)**
- ‚ùå Audio file uploads
- ‚ùå Real-time processing
- ‚ùå Advanced analytics
- ‚ùå Complex UI/UX
- ‚ùå Extensive error recovery

---

## ‚ö° Accelerated Development Strategy

### **Parallel Development Tracks**

#### **Track 1: Backend (Node.js + Python)**
```bash
Day 1-2: Core processing pipeline
Day 3-4: Jira integration + storage
Day 5-6: Testing + deployment
```

#### **Track 2: Frontend (React)**
```bash
Day 1-2: Basic components
Day 3-4: Jira panel integration
Day 5-6: Polish + fixes
```

### **Time-Saving Decisions**

1. **Python Libraries**: Use pre-built solutions
   ```python
   # Quick wins with existing libraries
   import nltk
   from fuzzywuzzy import fuzz
   import re
   ```

2. **UI Framework**: Forge UI Kit (no custom CSS)
   ```javascript
   // Built-in components = faster development
   import { Button, Text, Form } from '@forge/react';
   ```

3. **Database**: Simplified schema (expand later)
   ```sql
   -- Minimal tables for MVP
   meetings, ticket_mentions, basic_config
   ```

4. **Testing**: Manual + basic automation only
5. **Error Handling**: Log everything, fail gracefully

## üîß Daily Standup Format

### **Each Morning (15 minutes)**
- ‚úÖ Yesterday's completed tasks
- üéØ Today's priority (max 3 items)
- üö´ Blockers (resolve immediately)
- ‚ö° Risk mitigation

### **Each Evening (15 minutes)**
- ‚úÖ Deployment test (`forge tunnel`)
- üìù Tomorrow's preparation
- üîÑ Scope adjustments (if needed)

---

## üö® Risk Mitigation

### **High-Risk Items**
1. **Python Integration Complexity**
   - **Mitigation**: Start with simple child_process
   - **Fallback**: Pure Node.js processing

2. **Forge Learning Curve**
   - **Mitigation**: Use official templates
   - **Fallback**: Simplify to basic functions

3. **Jira API Integration**
   - **Mitigation**: Mock first, integrate later
   - **Fallback**: Basic display without updates

### **Daily Go/No-Go Decisions**
- **Day 2**: Python integration working?
- **Day 3**: Jira panel displaying data?
- **Day 4**: End-to-end flow complete?
- **Day 5**: Production deployment successful?

---
